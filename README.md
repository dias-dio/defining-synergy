# A statistical framework for defining synergistic anticancer drug interactions

A statistical framework to detect significant drug combination synergies in cancer. Using reference null distributions across various synergy metrics and tissue types, we provide empirical p-values to standardize synergy detection, uncover novel effects, and enable rigorous evaluation of drug combinations.
